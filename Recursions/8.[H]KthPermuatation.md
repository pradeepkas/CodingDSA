## Find K-th Permutation Sequence

Examples:

Example 1:

Input: N = 3, K = 3
 
Output: “213”

Explanation: The sequence has 3! permutations as illustrated in the figure above. K = 3 corresponds to the third sequence.

Example 2:

Input: N = 3, K = 5 

Result: “312”

Explanation: The sequence has 3! permutations as illustrated in the figure above. K = 5 corresponds to the fifth sequence.

➡️ We place each number based on its position in the permutation block.
➡️ For n = 4, each number fixes (n-1)! = 6 permutations. So if k = 16, we find its block: 16 / 6 = 2 (0-based, so 3rd block).
➡️ Recursively solve for the remaining numbers and updated k.

```swift

        var result = [Int]()
        kthPermutationRecursive([1,2,3,4], k: 16, result: &result) // asking for 17th 
        //kthPermutationRecursive([1,2,3], k: 4, result: &result) // asking for 5th

        print("Result \(result)")

// k wil k-1 always as we are taking zeroth index based appaoach

    func kthPermutationRecursive(_ numbers: [Int], k: Int, result: inout [Int]) {
        if numbers.isEmpty { return }

        let factorial = factorial(numbers.count - 1)
        let index = k / factorial
        let newK = k % factorial

        result.append(numbers[index])

        var newNumbers = numbers
        newNumbers.remove(at: index)

        kthPermutationRecursive(newNumbers, k: newK, result: &result)
    }

    func factorial( _ n: Int) -> Int {
        if n == 0 { return 1 }
        var res = 1
        for i in 1...n {
            res *= i
        }
        return res
    }
