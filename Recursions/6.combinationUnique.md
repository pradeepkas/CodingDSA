## Combination Sum II - Find all unique combinations


https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/combination-sum-ii-find-all-unique-combinations/

In this article we will solve the most asked interview question "Combination Sum II - Find all unique combinations".

Problem Statement: Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target. Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Examples:

Example 1:

Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8

Output: 
[
[1,1,6],
[1,2,5],
[1,7],
[2,6]]


Explanation: These are the unique combinations whose sum is equal to target.


>> need sorted array 



```swift
        var result = [[Int]]()
        combinationSum2(0, target: 8, arr: [10,1,2,7,6,1,5].sorted(), temp: [], result: &result)
        //combinationSum2(0, target: 5, arr: [2,5,2,1,2].sorted(), temp: [], result: &result)
        
        print("result \(result)")

    func combinationSum2(_ index: Int, target: Int, arr: [Int], temp: [Int], result: inout [[Int]]) {
        if target == 0 {
            result.append(temp)
            return
        }
        if index == arr.count || target < 0 {
            return
        }

        for i in index..<arr.count {
            if i > index && arr[i] == arr[i - 1] {
                continue
            }

            if arr[i] > target {
                break
            }

            combinationSum2(i + 1, target: target - arr[i], arr: arr, temp: temp + [arr[i]], result: &result)
        }
    }

        ```
