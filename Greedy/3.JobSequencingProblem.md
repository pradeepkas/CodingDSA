## Job Sequencing Problem

Problem Statement: You are given a set of N jobs where each job comes with a deadline and profit. The profit can only be earned upon completing the job within its deadline. Find the number of jobs done and the maximum profit that can be obtained. Each job takes a single unit of time and only one job can be performed at a time.

Example 1:

Input: N = 4, Jobs = {(1,4,20),(2,1,10),(3,1,40),(4,1,30)}

Output: 2 60

Explanation: The 3rd job with a deadline 1 is performed during the first unit of time .The 1st job is performed during the second unit of time as its deadline is 4.
Profit = 40 + 20 = 60

Example 2:

Input: N = 5, Jobs = {(1,2,100),(2,1,19),(3,2,27),(4,1,25),(5,1,15)}

Output: 2 127

Explanation: The  first and third job both having a deadline 2 give the highest profit. 
Profit = 100 + 27 = 127

> Note: in this we can perform any jobs lets say if deadline is 3 that means this job can perform at 1 or 2 or 3 any places whereever we have space.
 
> in this we are sorting profit so that we can adjust above logic first means higher values will be filled first.


```swift
    func jobSequencingProblem(_ data: [(Int, Int, Int)]) -> Int {
        let sortedData = data.sorted(by: {$0.2 > $1.2})
        var maxDeadline = 0
        for job in sortedData {
            if maxDeadline < job.1 {
                maxDeadline = job.1
            }
        }
        var jobTimeline = Array(repeating: -1, count: maxDeadline)
        
        var totalProfit = 0
        for job in sortedData {
            var timeSlot = job.1 - 1
            while ( timeSlot >= 0 ) {
                if jobTimeline[timeSlot] == -1 {
                    totalProfit += job.2
                    jobTimeline[timeSlot] = job.0
                    break
                }
                timeSlot -= 1
            }
        }
        return totalProfit
    }

> Note or improvement : we can use disjoint in place of while loop inside for loop its menas we can reduce O(n*n) to O(nlogn)
