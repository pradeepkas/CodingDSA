https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/find-minimum-number-of-coins/

Problem Statement: Given a value V, if we want to make a change for V Rs, and we have an infinite supply of each of the denominations in Indian currency, i.e., we have an infinite supply of { 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000} valued coins/notes, what is the minimum number of coins and/or notes needed to make the change.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: V = 70

Output: 2
Explaination: We need a 50 Rs note and a 20 Rs note.

Example 2:
Input: V = 121
Output: 3

Explaination: We need a 100 Rs note, a 20 Rs note and a 1 Rs coin.




```swift
    func findMiminumNumberOfCoin(_ value: Int) -> Int {
        let denominations = [1000, 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]
        
        var value = value
        var totalCoin = 0
        for denomination in denominations {
            if value >= denomination {
                let count = value/denomination
                print("denomination \(denomination) -- \(count)")
                totalCoin += count
                value = value%denomination
            }
        }
        print("totalCoin \(totalCoin)")
        return totalCoin
    }
