## N meetings in one room

https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/n-meetings-in-one-room/

Problem Statement: There is one meeting room in a firm. You are given two arrays, start and end each of size N.For an index ‘i’, start[i] denotes the starting time of the ith meeting while end[i]  will denote the ending time of the ith meeting. Find the maximum number of meetings that can be accommodated if only one meeting can happen in the room at a  particular time. Print the order in which these meetings will be performed.


Input:  N = 6,  start[] = {1,3,0,5,8,5}, end[] =  {2,4,5,7,9,9}

Output: 1 2 4 5

Explanation: See the figure for a better understanding.

```swift
    func maxMeetingInSingleRoom(_ start: [Int], end: [Int]) -> Int {
        
        if start.isEmpty || end.isEmpty { return 0 }
                
        var meetings = [(Int, Int, Int)]() // (start, end, Index)
        
        for index in 0..<start.count {
            meetings.append((start[index], end[index], index+1))
        }
        meetings = meetings.sorted(by: { $0.1 < $1.1 })
        print("meetingTimeHolder \(meetings)")
        
        var totalMeetings = 1
        var lastEndTime = meetings[0].1
        
        for index in 1..<meetings.count {
            let start = meetings[index].0
            if lastEndTime < start {
                lastEndTime = meetings[index].1
                totalMeetings += 1
            }
        }
        print("total meetings \(totalMeetings)")
        return totalMeetings
    }
