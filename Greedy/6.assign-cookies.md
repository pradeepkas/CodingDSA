## Assign Cookies 

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

   ```swift
    func findContentChildren(_ g: [Int], _ s: [Int]) -> Int {
        if g.count < 1 || s.isEmpty {
            return 0
        }
        
        let g = g.sorted()
        let s = s.sorted()
        
        var child = 0
        var cookies = 0
        
        while child < g.count && cookies < s.count {
            if s[cookies] >= g[child] {
                child += 1
            }
            cookies += 1
        }
        print(child)
        return child
    }
