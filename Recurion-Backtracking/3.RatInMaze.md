## Rat in a Maze

https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/rat-in-a-maze/

Consider a rat placed at (0, 0) in a square matrix of order N * N. It has to reach the destination at (N - 1, N - 1). Find all possible paths that the rat can take to reach from source to destination. The directions in which the rat can move are 'U'(up), 'D'(down), 'L' (left), 'R' (right). Value 0 at a cell in the matrix represents that it is blocked and the rat cannot move to it while value 1 at a cell in the matrix represents that rat can travel through it.

Note: In a path, no cell can be visited more than one time.

Print the answer in lexicographical(sorted) order

Examples:

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
m[][] = {{1, 0, 0, 0},
        {1, 1, 0, 1}, 
        {1, 1, 0, 0},
        {0, 1, 1, 1}}

```swift
func ratProblem(_ board: [[Int]], row: Int, col: Int, res: [String], visited: inout [[Bool]]) {
        //print("res -- \(res)")
        if row == (board.count - 1) && col == (board.count - 1) {
            print("result \(res)")
            return
        }
        
        
        let factors = [(1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 0)]
        let direction = ["D", "L", "R", "U"]

        // for all posible way
        for index in 0..<factors.count {
            let factor = factors[index]
            let updatedRow = row + factor.0
            let updatedCol = col + factor.1
            if (updatedRow >= 0) && (updatedRow < board.count) && (updatedCol >= 0) && (updatedCol < board.count) {
                if board[updatedRow][updatedCol] == 1 && visited[updatedRow][updatedCol] == false {
                    visited[row][col] = true
                    ratProblem(board, row: updatedRow, col: updatedCol, res: res + [direction[index]], visited: &visited)
                    visited[row][col] = false
                }
            }
        }
    }

ðŸ§® Time Complexity:
O(4^(N*N)) in the worst case (each cell has 4 directions), but pruned by visited matrix.

ðŸ§  Space Complexity:
O(NÂ²) due to recursion stack and visited matrix.
