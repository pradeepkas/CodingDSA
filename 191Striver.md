# Array

## 1. Set Matrix Zero

[Set Matrix Zero](/Arrays/Medium/setMatrixZero.md)
-- 1. use Int.Min in place zero then replace
-- 2. use extraa column and row to maintain zeros

## 2. Pascal Triangle

[Pascal Triangle](/Arrays/Hard/pascal.md)
-- 1. basic rule: n-1Cr-1, from this we can make opne formula like 

## 3. Next Permutation

[Next Permutation](/Arrays/Medium/next_permutation.md)
-- 1. Find first breakout point (fromLast < goingToFirstElement) and then repalce that element and make reverse of rest of elements 

## 4. Kadane's Algorithm

[Kadane's Algorithm](/Arrays/Medium/KadaneORmaxSubArrSum.md)

-- if current sum < 0 then leave and take next element as new sum 

## 5. Sort an array of 0's, 1's and 2's

[Sort an array of 0's, 1's and 2's](/Arrays/Medium/Sort0s1s2s.md)
1. best is ducth notation algorithm
2. otherwise hashing (will not maintain ordering)

## 6. Stock Buy and Sell

[Stock Buy and Sell](/Arrays/Medium/StockBuyAndSell.md)
1. start from last and look for profit for each element
