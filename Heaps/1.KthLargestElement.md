## KthLargestElement

https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/kth-largest-smallest-element-in-an-array/


Example 1:
Input: Array = [1,2,6,4,5,3] , K = 3 
Output: kth largest element = 4, kth smallest element = 3

Example 2:
Input: Array = [1,2,6,4,5] , k = 3
Output : kth largest element = 4,  kth smallest element = 4

Best example 
[2,10,8,7,5,4,3,9,6,0,1]


>use same logic but we have to run loop that many times 


>Time Complexity: O(n log k)
>Space Complexity: O(k)
