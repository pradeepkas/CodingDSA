## Binary Search 


### 1. Upper Bound/ lower bound 

### 2. insert position in sorted array for given element

### 3. first and last occurence : take an sorted array and think by looking, need to visulize 

### 4. minimum element in sorted rotated array

### 5. Median of Two Sorted Arrays of different sizes 

if total number is even than median will take two center element (ele1+ele2)/2
else center element will median only

- three approach 
1. first take extraa araray and calcucalute vauel on taht elemetn 
2. take virutal value not extraa data strucutur and use that as pointer 

3. use valid symmetric logic and then take shotest array and apply binary search on that 


### 6. K-th element of two sorted arrays
need revision
here we will devide array on basis of k means left will contain k elements and right (n-k) n is totoal element
and will return max(l1,l2)

but we carefull for low and high 
low = max (0, k-n1)
hight = min(n1, k)
