### Heaps


## 1. KthLargestElement

It will solve using Heap, then we are using min heap, and will run loop k times and will take elements out

## 2. Maximum Sum Combination

in this we can thinking, matrix of sums and then we are picking one elements each time
(0,0) -> (0,1), (1,0)
(0,1) -> (1,1), (0,2)
(1,0) -> (2,0),(1,1)(its already exist)


## 3. K most frequent elements
1. Using hashmap we can do 
2. Using min heap, Data Structure we can count with element and counter

## 4. find-median-from-data-stream

Two Heaps: Max Heap (left half), Min Heap (right half); maintain balance so that maxHeap ≥ minHeap in size.

Insertion: Add to maxHeap → move max to minHeap → rebalance if needed by moving minHeap’s top back to maxHeap.
