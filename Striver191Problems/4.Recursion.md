## 1. Subset Sum : Sum of all Subsets

- Use pick/not-pick approach to explore all subsets by either including or excluding each element.


## 2. Subset - II | Print all the Unique Subsets
- Use pick/not-pick approach and store subsets in Set to keep them unique

## 3. Combination Sum - 1
- Use pick/not-pick.
- Pick the same element multiple times until the target is met.
- Stop picking if the sum exceeds the target.

## 4. Combination Sum II - Find all unique combinations
- Use pick/not-pick with multiple branches.
- Each element is picked only once.
- Sort the input and skip duplicates to avoid repeated combinations.

## 5. Palindrome Partitioning
- Use partitioning with multiple branches for each substring.
- Check if the substring is a palindrome; if not, skip further branching.
- This is a brute-force approach; DP can optimize repeated palindrome checks.



## 6. Find K-th Permutation Sequence

➡️ We place each number based on its position in the permutation block.
➡️ For n = 4, each number fixes (n-1)! = 6 permutations. So if k = 16, we find its block: 16 / 6 = 2 (0-based, so 3rd block).
➡️ Recursively solve for the remaining numbers and updated k.
