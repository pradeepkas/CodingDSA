## Recursion and Backtracking

### 1. Print All Permutations of a String/Array
- Use a tracker to mark used numbers, run a loop over all elements, and pick unused ones for each recursion branch.

### 2. N Queen Problem | Return all Distinct Solutions to the N-Queens Puzzle
- Use backtracking to place queens row by row
- Check 3 directions for safety:
    - Same column
    - Upper-left diagonal
    - Upper-right diagonal
- Place queen, move to next row
- If stuck, backtrack (undo last placement)
- Store board as list of strings when all queens are placed
- Optimize using arrays: cols[], diag1[], diag2[] for O(1) safety checks

### 3. Rat Maze problem
Here, we need to explore all possible paths. Always remember to mark the current cell (i, j) as visited before moving forward. For more clarity, refer to the solution and observe how the visited array is used to control traversal and backtracking.
