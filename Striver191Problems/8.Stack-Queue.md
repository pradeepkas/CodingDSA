## Stack and Queue

Stack : FILO

Queue: FIFO

| Queue Type        | Insertion | Deletion                | Order          | Use Case Example            |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Simple Queue      | Rear      | Front                   | FIFO           | Print queue                 |
| Circular Queue    | Rear      | Front                   | FIFO           | Circular buffers            |
| Deque             | Both ends | Both ends               | Flexible       | Browser history             |
| Priority Queue    | Any       | Highest/Lowest Priority | Priority-based | OS task scheduling          |
| Circular Deque    | Both ends | Both ends               | Circular       | Advanced scheduling         |
| Thread-safe Queue | Depends   | Depends                 | Thread-safe    | Multi-threaded data sharing |


simple queue: space waster even tough we have space 
circular queue: it will start again from zero with circualr manner

## 1. Stack using single queue
 
## 2. Implement Queue using Stack

## 3. Next Greater Element
Using stack only from last to first, we have to consider array with 2n means it will be like ([] + []) we are adding, not acutally we are adding but for undesrtading so that we can complete 

## 4. sort stack

using another temp stack and maintain temp stack in order, means
