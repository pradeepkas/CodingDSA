## 1. N meetings in one room

- We hold the meeting data in a structured format, such as a tuple: (start, end, index).
- We sort the array of tuples based on meeting end times to prioritize the earliest finishing meetings.
- After sorting, we iterate through the meetings to check for overlaps.
- By comparing the current meeting's start time with the end time of the last selected meeting (tracked using a pointer), we can decide whether to schedule the current meeting or skip it.
- This approach helps us efficiently track non-overlapping meetings for optimal room usage.

## 2. Minimum number of platforms required for a railway

- To handle time-related comparisons, we can use the "HH:mm" format along with a fixed time zone (TimeZone(secondsFromGMT: 0)), which makes time comparison straightforward.
- After converting the strings to Date, we can store them in a data structure such as a tuple for easy pairing of start and end times.
- Then, we compare each new train’s start time with the earliest end time currently in use:
  - If the start time is greater than the end time, we can reuse the platform.
  - Otherwise, a new platform is needed.

Note: Later we can suggest for minHeap as well

## 3. Job Sequencing Problem

- Each job can be placed in any free slot ≤ deadline.
- Sort jobs by profit (desc) to maximize earnings.
- Place each job in the latest free slot before its deadline.
- Greedy approach to maximize total profit.

## 4. Fractional Knapsack Problem : Greedy Approach

- Calculate _profit/weight_ ratio for each item.
- Sort items by ratio in decreasing order.
- Pick full item if it fits, else take the fraction that fits.
- Stop when capacity is full.

## 5. Find minimum number of coins

- Use denominations in descending order.
- For each, if it fits in the remaining value:
  Take as many as possible.
  Subtract from the remaining value.
  Count coins/notes used.
- Repeat until value becomes 0.

## 6. Assign Cookies

- Sort both arrays in decreasing order.
- Pick one item from each array and check if s[j] >= g[i].
- If matched, increase the counter; otherwise, skip without increment.
