### Pattern finder

With this pattern recognition cheatsheet you will be able to solve more than 80% of the problems:

➡️Array / String Inputs

1. Is the array sorted?

- Yes → Think: Binary Search, Two Pointers, or Prefix Sums.
- No → Move to structural/intent-based decisions.

2. What's the intent of the problem?

- Optimization (Max/Min, count of ways, min cost)
- Interdependent choices? → Use Dynamic Programming (Top-Down or Bottom-Up).
- Independent decisions? → Consider a Greedy approach (with proof of correctness).
- Feasibility / Existence Check
- Use Backtracking, DFS with pruning, or Binary Search on Answer.

- Does it involve String Manipulation?
- Prefix/Suffix logic? → Trie, Rolling Hash, or Z-Algorithm.
- Sequential manipulation? → Stack, Monotonic Stack, or Deque.

- Frequent lookups / duplicates / uniqueness
- Use Hash Maps, Hash Sets, or Counting Arrays.

- Sliding window behavior
- Use Two Pointers, Deque, or Counting Hash Map.

- Frequent Min/Max retrieval
- Use Heap, Monotonic Queue, or Segment Tree (for range queries).

➡️ Graph Inputs

1. Pathfinding / Traversals

Shortest path / fewest steps → BFS (Unweighted), Dijkstra (Weighted).

Exhaustive exploration / component discovery → DFS, Union-Find.

2. Cycle Detection / Topological Order

Use DFS with visited tracking, Kahn’s Algorithm, or Disjoint Sets.

3. Optimization on graphs

Minimum Spanning Tree? → Kruskal, Prim.

Connectivity? → Tarjan's Algorithm, Bridge Finding, etc.

➡️ Tree Inputs (Typically Binary Trees)

1. Traversals / Depth Calculations

Level-order traversal / Lowest Common Ancestor → Use BFS / DFS with depth tracking.

Recursive divide-and-conquer logic → Postorder traversal is your friend.

2. Balancing / Ordering Constraints

Use BST properties, AVL / Red-Black trees, or Segment Trees if mutable.

➡️ Linked List Inputs

1. Cycle detection → Fast/Slow Pointers
2. Structural changes

Reversal? → Track prev, curr, next pointers.

Head/edge cases? → Use a dummy node strategy.
