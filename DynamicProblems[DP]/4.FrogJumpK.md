## 4. Dynamic Programming: Frog Jump with k Distances (DP 4)

In this article, we will learn about "Dynamic Programming: Frog Jump with k Distances (DP 4)"

Problem Statement:  Frog Jump with K Distance/ Learn to write 1D DP

Problem Statement:

This is a follow-up question to “Frog Jump” discussed in the previous article. In the previous question, the frog was allowed to jump either one or two steps at a time. In this question, the frog is allowed to jump up to ‘K’ steps at a time. If K=4, the frog can jump 1,2,3, or 4 steps at every index.

## simple recursion

```swift
f(n) {

    if n == 0 {
        return 0
    }

    else {
        var currentMin = Int.Max
        for j to 1 to k {
            var step = f(n-j) + abs(h[n] - h[n-j])
            currentMin = min(currentMin, step)
        }
        return curretMin
    }

}
```

## memoization 

```swift

var dp = [n] //initialize with -1

f(n) {

    if n == 0 {
        return 0
    }

    else {

        if dp[n] != -1 {
            return dp[n]
        }

        var currentMin = Int.Max
        for j to 1 to k {
            if n-j > 0{
                var step = f(n-j) + abs(h[n] - h[n-j])
                currentMin = min(currentMin, step)
            }
        }
        dp[n] = currentMin
        return dp[n]
    }
}
```


## tablutation 

```swift

var dp = [n] //initialize with -1

f(n) {
    dp[0] = 0
     for item in 0..<n {
            for j to 1 to k {
                var step = f(item-j) + abs(h[item] - h[item-j])
                currentMin = min(currentMin, step)
            }
            dp[n] = currentMin
        }
    return dp[n-1]
}
```
