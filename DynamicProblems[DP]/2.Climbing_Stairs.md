### Climbing Stairs

-- Given a number of stairs. Starting from the 0th stair we need to climb to the “Nth” stair. At a time we can climb either one or two steps. We need to return the total number of distinct ways to reach from 0th to Nth stair.

## About DP problem (understanding DP problem) -> 1D problem- 
#### with these points we can convert problme to recursion then recursion to DP

1. try to represent problem in term of Index 
2. Do all stuff on that index according to problem statement 
3. then do a/c to question: like sum all the ways or minimum or maximum of the ways 


## recursion 

 ```swift
f(n) 
if n == 0 || n == 1 {
    return 1
} else {
    return f(n-1) + f(n-2)
}
 ```


## memoization 

 ```swift

f(n) 

arr[n] = -1 initialize

if arr[n] != -1 {return arr[n]}
if n == 0 || n == 1 {
    arr[n] = 1
    return 1
} else {
    arr[n] = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
    return arr[n]
}
 ```

## tabluation : its bottom up approach
bcz we are hving base case already 

```swift

f(n) 

arr[n] = -1 //initialize with -1 whole arr
arr[0] = 1
arr[1] = 1

for i to 2..<n {
    arr[i] = arr(i-1) + arr(i-2)
}
return arr[n]

 ```
