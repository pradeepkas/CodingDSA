## singleNumber
measns single occurence,  all other elements will be there twice.

example:   
[4,1,2,1,2]  
ans : 4
```
1. using hashmap
2. using XOR 

## USING XOR

> ←Property 1: XOR of two same numbers is always 0 i.e. `a ^ a = 0`. 

> ←Property 2: XOR of a number with 0 will result in the number itself i.e. `0 ^ a = a`.

```swift
    func singleNumber(_ nums: [Int]) -> Int {
        var xor = 0
        for ele in nums {
            xor = xor ^ ele 
        }
        return xor
    }
```


> A little theory

```markdown
The XOR (exclusive OR) operation is a logical operation that compares two binary digits and returns 1 if they are different and 0 if they are the same. It is represented by the symbol "^".

The XOR operation has several properties that make it useful in various algorithms and problems. Some of the most important properties of XOR are:

Commutative: The order of the operands does not affect the result, so a^b = b^a
Associative: The grouping of the operands does not affect the result, so (a^b)^c = a^(b^c)
Identity: a^0 = a
Inverse: a^a = 0
